# ðŸ§® Array Cardio (JS30 - Day 4)

This project showcases the power of array methods in JavaScript such as `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `reduce()` by applying them to real-world datasets. Built as part of the JavaScript30 challenge by Wes Bos.

ðŸ”¥ Features
- Filter a list of inventors by birth year  
- Map inventors to full name strings  
- Sort inventors by birth date and years lived  
- Calculate total years lived by all inventors  
- Sort people alphabetically by last name  
- Count instances of items using `reduce()`  

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- HTML (for output display)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Modern JavaScript Array Methods:
  - `filter()`
  - `map()`
  - `sort()`
  - `reduce()`

ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Using `filter()` to extract data based on conditions  
- Using `map()` to transform arrays into new formats  
- Using `sort()` to order data by values (numbers or strings)  
- Using `reduce()` to accumulate or count data  
- Best practices for writing readable, functional-style JavaScript  
- Real-world scenarios for using array methods together
